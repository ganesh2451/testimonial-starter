    text: "Ace is a good person, he was born the son of Roger and lived with a form of ancestor shaming. He could never escape that and it was his curse. Sabo and Luffy both taught him to get past it. Ace had to learn how to be polite, which took some time and he was held back by Luffy's stupidity at times.",

    name: "Luffy",
    crew: "Straw Hats",
    image: "./image/luffy.jpg",
    text: "Luffy is such a love or hate character and imagining a live action for him seems like a recipe for disaster. But Godoy somehow is able to maintain the goofiness within the character without making him unbearable, and that deserves some applause.",

    name: "Shanks",
    crew: "Red Haired",
    image: "./image/shanks.jpg",
    text: "While Shanks being evil would be a monumental plot twist, he'll likely remain the admirable and trustworthy guy Luffy has always known him as. Even if Oda wanted to reveal Shanks as evil at one point",

    name: "Whitebeard",
    crew: "whitebeard pirates",
    image: "./image/whitebeard.jpg",
    text: "Whitebeard was a compassionate man, having adopted countless people of different backgrounds into his crew as his foster children, such as Squard, whose life was devastated by Roger killing his crew, or Teach, who requested to join his crew due to being homeless.",

    text: "Zoro has become a fan favorite and a true symbol of the One Piece franchise due to his unyielding attitude, incredible ability with a blade, and undying dedication to his companions. Zoro has done many fantastic things in his life, but his most notable ones are what make him a hero.",
